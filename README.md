Blood Protein Dataset Analysis

In an attempt to develop blood protein biomarkers for a certain type of cancer, the level of 120 proteins were measured in the blood plasma of some patients and controls. 


Techniques:

(1) Use a dimension reduction technique to show visualization of data points in low dimensional space. 

(2) Use at least two clustering techniques to cluster the proteins. 

(3) Split the data in a 3:1:1 ratio into training, validation, and testing sets. 

-	Use at least 3 classifiers, and tune each classifier with cross-validation using the training data. 

-	Select the best classifier based on their performance on the validation data. 

-	Assess the performance of the best classifier using the testing data.
